<h1>ProteomeCommons.org IO Framework 3.0</h1>
<p>This is a free, open-source, Java framework for handling spectra and peak list files. The framework can read and write to a number of different spectra and peak list formats, and the framework provides a simple, intuitive Java object model for working with spectra or peak lists. The overall goal of this project is to make working with peak list or spectral data easy, even if you are working with various different file formats or if you are working with incredibly large files. Additionally, we aren't trying to lock developers in to using Java. Utility programs are included that will translate peak list or spectral data in to a simple, plain text format that is well-suited for pasing via regular expressions in perl, python, vbscript, or any other programming language.</p>
<p>In short, the goal of this framework is to support all the popular MS and MSMS data formats, and to eliminate any time or effort involved in figuring out how to read and write peak list or spectrum files.</p>
<p>You may always find a current download of this framework at <a href="http://www.proteomecommons.org/current/531/">http://www.proteomecommons.org/current/531/</a></p>

<h2><a name="knownformats">Known Formats</a></h2>
<p>The following peak list formats are supported, to the extend documented here.</p>
<h3><a name="mgf"></a>Mascot Generic Format (MGF)</h3>
<p>MGF file format support is based on Matrix Science LLC's generic format. Complete MGF format support is provided by this framework; however, meta-information support is not well tested.</p>

<h3><a name="dta"></a>Sequest DTA</h3>
<p>DTA file format support is based on Finnigan's LCQ file format. Complete DTA file support is provided by this framework. Any file ending with ".dta" is treated as if it is in the sequest DTA format.</p>

<h3><a name="pkl"></a>Micromass PKL</h3>
<p>PKL file format support is based on Micromass's PKL file format. Complete read and write support for the PKL format is implemented, including multiple peak lists in a single file.</p>

<h3><a name="txt"></a>Plain Text</h3>
<p>Read support is provided for spectra or peak lists that are in plain-text format with each peak's m/z value and intensity value on the same line and a single line for each peak. Specialized support existing for both MS Windows and non-Windows users, particularly support for people who want to look at spectra in notepad.</p>

<h3><a name="wiff"></a>Agilent QS WIFF</h3>
<p>Support is implemented for reading plain-text WIFF exports from Analyst QS. Full support for the WIFF file format is in the works, and if you are interested in helping please contact <a href="mailto:jfalkner@umich.edu">Jayson Falkner</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="t2d"></a>Applied Biosystems T2D</h3>
<p>Complete support is provided for reading and writing files in the T2D format. The support is based on the ProteomeCommons.org IO-T2D project, which was created in collaboration with Applied Biosystems. Further documentation may be found in the "ProteomeCommons.org IO-T2D" project at <a href="http://www.proteomecommons.org">ProteomeCommons.org</a></p>

<h3><a name="raw"></a>Thermo Finnigan RAW</h3>
<p>Support for reading and writing Thermo Finnigan's RAW file format is in progress. Please contact <a href="mailto:jfalkner@umich.edu">Jayson Falkner</a> if you are interested in helping.</p>

<h3><a name="mzXML"></a>Systems Biology mzXML</h3>
<p>mzXML is an open, XML based file format designed by Systems Biology. The framework supports reading either peak list or spectral data that is in the mzXML file format support as described n the <a href="http://sashimi.sourceforge.net/software_glossolalia.html">mzXML schema and documentation</a>. This framework provides read support of peak lists and spectra in *.mzXML files. Proper stream-based XML parsing is used, allowing for mzXML files of any size to be used. Proper Base64 decoding is also used, allowing for data in either 32 bit or 64 bit precision.</p>

<h3><a name="mzData"></a>HUPO mzData</h3>
<p>mzData is an open, XML based file format designed by US HUPO. The framework supports reading and writing data that is in the mzData file format as defined by the <a href="http://psidev.sourceforge.net/ms/xml/mzdata/mzdata.xsd">schema</a> and accompanying <a href="http://psidev.sourceforge.net/ms/xml/mzdata/mzdata.html">documentation</a>. Proper stream-based XML parsing is used, allowing for mzData files of any size to be used.

<h3><a name="zip"></a>ZIP Data</h3>
<p>ZIP compression is not a  MS or MSMS data format. It is a compression algorithm that optimizes the amount of space a file requires. You can ZIP compress any file and the file will shrink in size, unless it is already compressed. In general, plain text files compress very well and you can save a lot of space by compressing your peak list files.</p>
<p>The IO Framework provides seamless support for ZIP compressing any of the other formats. Simply ZIP compress any of your data and save it with ".zip" added to the file name, e.g. "example.mgf" would be compressed and saved as "example.mgf.zip". The framework will automatically decompress or compress files with such naming and pass the uncompressed data along to the appropriate code in the IO framework.</p>
<p>If you don't already have it, <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/Zip.html">here is free ZIP code</a> for every major operating system.</p>

<h2><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<p>This is a list of frequently asked questions based on user e-mails from the <a href="http://www.proteomecommons.org">ProteomeCommons.org e-mail list</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#whereconvert">Where is that peak list conversion tool?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#whydoesntjar">Why doesn't "<code>java -jar ProteomeCommons.org-IO.jar</code>" work?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#wheredoigethelp">Where do I get help?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#dontemailus">Why shouldn't I ask the developers how to use their code?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="whereconvert"></a>Where is that peak list conversion tool?</h3>
<p>The on-line GUI tool that converts peak lists is <a href="ConvertPeakList.jnlp">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="whydoesntjar"></a>Why doesn't "<code>java -jar ProteomeCommons.org-IO.jar</code>" work?</h3>
<p>The JAR file included with the code is not executable. It is intended to be used as a Java library, i.e. "java -cp ProteomeCommons.org-IO.jar <class file>". If you'd like to run the example programs from command line, try executing "<code>java -cp ProteomeCommons.org-IO.jar org.proteomecommons.io.util.PrintPeakList <i>peaklist file</i></code>", where you replace <i>peaklist-file</i> with the location of a real peak list.</p>

<h3><a name="wheredoigethelp"></a>Where do I get help?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, this is free, open-source code. You don't get free tech support with your download. However, there are options for getting help. The best help comes straight from the people who made this code. If you are willing to hire the core developers to help with your problem or to teach you how the framework works, contact <a href="jfalkner@umich.edu">Jayson Falkner</a>. If you want free help, use the e-mail list at ProteomeCommons.org. Most of the developer and users of this framework are on that e-mail list, and it is the appropriate place to look for free advice.</p>

<h3><a name="dontemailus"></a>Why shouldn't I ask the developers how to user their code?</h3>
<p>This is free, open-source code. You don't get free tech support with your download, and the developers of this project don't appreciate it when you try directly ask them how to use the code. If think the project is helpful, that is great, but please use the <a href=#wheredoigethelp"">suggested methods</a> for getting your user-related questions answered.</p>
