<h1>ProteomeCommons.org IO Framework 2.0</h1>
<p>This is a proper Java framework for handling spectra and peak lists. The framework can read and write to a number of different spectra and peak list formats, and the framework provides a simple, intuitive Java object model for working with spectra or peak lists. All classes support two methods of handling peak list and spectrum data, in-memory or stream. The in memory model parses entire peak list(s) or spetrum(a) in to memory all at once -- it is fast and easy to use. The stream method parses peak list(s) or spectrum(a) data in to memory as requested -- ideal for low memory use and handling of extremely large data sets.</p>
<p>The goal of this framework is to support all the popular MS and MSMS data formats, and to eliminate any time or effort involved in figuring out how to read and write peak list or spectrum files.</p>

<h2><a name="credits">Credits</a></h2>
<p>This is a project supported and contributed to by many different people. Here is a formal list of all of those who have submitted code and/or documentation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jayson Falkner - jfalkner@umich.edu</li>
</ul>
<p>Support for this project, in part, comes from the <a href="http://www.proteomeconsortium.org">National Resource for Proteomics and Pathways (NRPP), http://www.proteomeconsortium.org</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="changes">Changes since 1.0</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Added PKL read/write support.</li>
  <li>Added DTA read/write support.</li>
  <li>Added example code for reading/printing peak list information. The program also serves as an abstraction point for piping peak list information in to a shell script.</li>
  <li>Added example code for converting between peak list formats.</li>
  <li>Updated Java Docs and fixed several formating bugs.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="formats">Peak List Formats Supported</a></h2>
<p>The following peak list formats are supported, to the extend documented here.</p>
<h3>Mascot Generic Format (MGF)</h3>
<p>MGF file format support is based on Matrix Science LLC's generic format.</p>
<p>Mostly complete support is implemented for reading and writing Mascot Generic Format files. Peak list information, parent ion charge, and parent ion mass information is preserved, but the other meta-information an MGF file may maintain is not. Any file that ends with ".mgf" is treated as if it is in Mascot Generic Format.</p>

<h3>Sequest DTA</h3>
<p>DTA file format support is based on Finnigan's LCQ file format.</p>
<p>Complete DTA file support is provided by this framework. Any file ending with ".dta" is treated as if it is in the sequest DTA format.</p>

<h3>Micromass PKL</h3>
<p>Micromass PKL file format support is based on the simple  DTA format but with optional concatination.</p>
<p>Partial PKL support is provided by this framework. The framework is not well tested on large PKL files. Any file ending with ".pkl" is treaded as if it is in the Micromass PKL file format.</p>

<h2><a name="examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>This IO library is useful for many different things, and a few tools are included to demonstrate how the IO library woks. Researchers may find these tools helpful for day-to-day use, and coders can use the source-code as an example of how to incorporate the ProteomeCommons.org IO library with their code.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#parsingAPeakList">How to parse a peak list.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#potentialModificationFinder">An example class that demonstrates using the I/O framework to scan a collection of peak lists and identify which peak lists may have a potential modification.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#printPeakList">Reading a peak list and printing out the mz, intensity, and charge information.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#convertPeakList">Converting peak lists from one format to another, optionally normalizing and/or sorting.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="parsingAPeakList">Parsing a Peak List</a></h2>
<p>It is near trivial to parse a peak list from a file in a known format. The code is the following:</p>
<pre>
// load the libraries
import org.proteomecommons.io.*;
...
// load the peak list
PeakList peaklist = PeakListReader.read("your-peaklist-file.mgf");
// modify the peak list some
...
// write out the new peak list to a file
PeakListWriter.write(peaklist, ".mgf");
</pre>
<p>The PeakList object provides the parent ion m/z(if available), the parent ion charge (if available), and a list of m/z and intensity pairings. Any Java program will quickly be able to load and analyze peak lists using this object. For other information that may be specific to a particular type of peak list format, simply cast the PeakList object in to an appropriate sub-class. There is an appropriate PeakListReader/PeakListWriter implementation for each peak list format supported by this framework. Along with those implementations are classes that deal with handling any additional information peak list formats may provide. See the <a href="docs/api/index.html">Java docs</a> for more information.</p>


<h2><a name="potentialModificationFinder">PotentialModificationFinder.java</a></h2>
<p>This tool lets you scan a directory of peak lists and ask if any of those peak lists has a peak that hints at a potential modification. You can specify the mass of the modification you are interested in and the mass accuracy to use. Returned from the program is a list of peak lists that have a peak at the m/z corresponding to the parent ion lacking the potential modifications. This tool is commonly used to find modifications such as phosphorilation, e.g. "java -jar PotentialModificationFinder.jar /peaklists/ --mz 80 --mz 98"</p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="printPeakList">PrintPeakList.java</a></h2>
<p>This tool parses a peak list of a known format, i.e. anything the framework supports, and it prints the same information, in a standardized format on the screen. This utility may be used as a simple, pipe method of exposing peak list data in a standard format. A shell script could use this class to abstract the task of reading a peak list file, which is particularly nice if you are attempting to read more than one file format.</p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="convertPeakList">ConvertPeakList.java</a></h2>
<p>This is tool that converts peak lists from one format to another, optionally normalizing peak intensities and/or sorting m/z values. The program is suitable for bulk translation of peak list files to and from any format supported by this framework.</p>
